# Blink

Relive the glory days of the early internet by re-introducing the `<blink>` tag.

## Installation and usage

Wrap the tags `<nu-blink></nu-blink>` around the content you want to blink just like the best of the web did back in the 90s.

If you're just interested in making the text blink in a normal HTML document add the `<script src="blink.js"></script>` to the end before the closing the `</html>` tag.

If you want to use it as part of a larger framework include however you would normally require your dependencies.

## Extra Horrors

After realising that I could add vanilla support for a whole host of new natively supoorted terrors I thought it only reasonable that I did so immediately. Please give a warm welcome to your new worst friends `nu-cycle`, `nu-spin`, `nu-clench`, `nu-flex` (there may be more to come).
