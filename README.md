# Blink

Relive the glory days of the early internet by re-introducing the `<blink>` tag.

## Installation and usage

Wrap the tags `<nu-blink></nu-blink>` around the content you want to blink just like the best of the web did back in the 90s.

If you're just interested in making the text blink in a normal HTML document add the `<script src="script.js"></script>` to the end before the closing the `</html>` tag.

If you want to use it as part of a larger framework include however you would normally require your dependencies.
